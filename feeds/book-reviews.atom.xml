The language is easy to read, and it goes as far as explaining the details of what processes are involved in creating the Docker container. As for the title, I wouldnâ€™t say of the content that it is a deep dive, but it is suffice to satisfy the initial curiosity of a Docker learner. Reading at least the initial parts of a second chapter of the book will be enough to get started and go along into using containers in production with &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com"&gt;Docker documentation&lt;/a&gt; at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Book Reviews"></category><category term="Docker"></category></entry></feed>
